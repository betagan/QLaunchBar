QLaunchBar adds a small Widget to the side of your Screen which holds several,
configurable Buttons to fire up your favourite applications, websites or
perform other scriptable tasks. It is hidden by default and slides in once your
mouse-cursor touches the edge of the screen, thus not interrupting your workflow.
